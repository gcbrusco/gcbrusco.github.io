                MY STORY
            </h1>
            <h2 id="sub-section-title">
                HELLO THERE!
            </h2>
            My name is <b>Gina</b>, thanks for taking a visit to my site :)
            <br>

            <h2 id="sub-section-title">
                WHERE I AM FROM
            </h2>

            As you can tell by the theme, I am a die-hard <b>New Yorker</b>. I come from a large, full-blooded Italian family, where almost all of my relatives live in either New York or Italy. So, yes. I am one of those "fogetaboutit" New York Italians
            with mandatory sunday dinners, traditional Catholic values, and an exaggerated use of hand gestures. I am the fourth born child of five, where I grew up with two brothers and two sisters. Family of seven – I know – it was just as chaotic as
            it seems.

            <h2 id="sub-section-title">
                WHAT I LIKE TO DO
            </h2>
            As you can see with the images on this site, one of my main interests is <b>graphic design</b>. Ever since my 10th grade art class in high school, I have been obsessed with drawing, painting, and digital design. A few art classes and contests
            later, this is unfortunately just a hobby to me now. However, I believe computer science requires just as much creativity as art does, where each empty terminal window is the same as a blank canvas.

                UNDERGRADUATE
            </h2>
            I am currently a junior at the <b>University of Notre Dame</b> majoring in Computer Science with a TBD minor, possibly Digital Marketing or Engineering Coporate Practices (a fancy way of saying a business-engineering hybrid).
            <br>Although I am interested in front-end design and software engineering, I hope to become an entrepreneur in the future, where I design and output products or software of my own to the world.

                HIGH SCHOOL
            </h2>
            I graduated from the <b>Holy Child</b> in Rye, NY in 2019. Some of the best years of my life, no doubt. The incredible Engineering & Design program paired with the all-girls environment really helped trailblaze my path into the STEM field.
            During my time at Holy Child, I recieved two awards for mathematics, one award for science, and a few external art awards. My overall highlight of high school was being the lead of my senior year production of Les Miserables.

            I like art. A lot. I have always been told I am a creative person - at least by my mom - so here is some of the work I have done in the past :)
